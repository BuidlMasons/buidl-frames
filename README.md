## Introduction

**Buidl Frames** is a Farcaster Frames-based slideshow project designed for rapid development and frame building with Scaffold-ETH 2. This repository leverages the innovative approach of using Scaffold-ETH 2 to create engaging and interactive slideshows. For this build, we utilized NFT Storage to pin the images on IPFS
